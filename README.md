# Comparative study of Customer Segmentation with Market Basket Analysis using various Clustering Algorithms
This repository showcases a comprehensive machine learning pipeline that combines **Customer Segmentation** and **Market Basket Analysis** to better understand customer behavior and optimize marketing strategies.

ðŸ”¹ **Customer Segmentation** is performed using the **KMeans Clustering algorithm**. The goal is to group customers into distinct clusters based on behavioral and transactional attributes such as purchase frequency, recency, and monetary value. These clusters help identify high-value customers, occasional buyers, and potential churners, enabling targeted marketing and personalized experiences.

ðŸ”¹ **Market Basket Analysis** is conducted using the **Apriori algorithm**. This unsupervised learning technique uncovers associations between products based on historical transaction data. By identifying frequent itemsets and generating association rules, it helps discover which products are often bought togetherâ€”insightful for cross-selling, bundling, and shelf arrangement strategies.

Together, this project offers a dual analytical approach:
- Segment customers to understand **"who"** your audience is.
- Analyze product affinity to learn **"what"** they prefer to buy together.

The project includes data preprocessing, model training, cluster visualization, and interpretation of association rules, making it an end-to-end solution for data-driven retail decision-making.
